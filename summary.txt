Bagualia alba is a new species of dinosaur that was recently discovered in South America. Scientists estimate that it was 4.5 meters long and 1.2 meters tall. It is believed to have lived 90 million years ago. Its most distinctive feature is a row of spines along its back that are thought to have been used for display rather than for defense. The discovery is expected to shed new light on the evolution of dinosaurs in the Southern Hemisphere.
